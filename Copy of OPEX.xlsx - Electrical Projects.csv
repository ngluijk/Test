Electrical SCADA,Adopt,Connectivity,FALSE,"<p>Electrical SCADA is widely adopted in various industries and offers the benefit of a visual representation of the electrical system, real-time status of equipment, consumption data and remote control. To avoid adopting different systems from various vendors delivering electrical equipment, a vendor agnostic approach is taken using <a href=""http:/www.copadata.com""> Copa-Data</a>. The benefit is a common platform which can be maintained centrally, reducing the overall maintenance overhead and improving cybersecurity robustness.</p>"
5G,Trial,Connectivity,TRUE,"<p>The wireless standard <a href=""https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/wireless-network/5g-benefits-features.html"" 5G </a> offers significant improvement over 4G, allowing 100x more data to be transferred, with predicted speeds of up to 10Gbps, and enhanced capacity of 1000x that of 4G and a reduced latency of up to 5ms round trip latency, allowing new IoT applications. The use of 5G will open up a more cost effective approach to provide communication in the field, allow large data transfer from data 'hungry' devices and allow Realtime control of equipment, such as robotic inspections.</p>"
